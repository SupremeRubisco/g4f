# g4f-replit
**Run g4f on replit with the built in gui!**

[![Run on Replit](https://replit.com/badge)](https://replit.com/new/github/SupremeRubisco/g4f-replit)

## How?
1. Make sure you are logged into [replit](replit.com/login)
2. Click the ``Run on Replit`` image above
3. It should have directed you to Replit where it created a Repl for you
4. Click the ``Start`` button
5. A blank page should have popped up on the right
6. Click the ``New Tab`` button
7. It should have opened the g4f gui in a new tab!

## Troubleshooting
- The site won't work anymore :(
  - Go back to the Repl and click the ``Start`` button again
- The ``Run on Replit`` button won't work
  - Go [here](https://replit.com/new/github/SupremeRubisco/g4f-replit). Or go [here](https://replit.com/github/SupremeRubisco/g4f-replit) and click fork
- Doesn't work
  - Go home and cry about it

## How it works
It just installs the [g4f](https://pypi.org/project/g4f/) python package and runs the gui from [gpt4free](https://github.com/xtekky/gpt4free). 

(Btw it's just four lines of code, so dumb people can just click the link above and run it without a single though)

## Credits

All goes to [@xtekky](https://github.com/xtekky), I did nothing.

## Updates
Maybe I'll make this more exciting and add other deployments for other services like vercel or glitch
